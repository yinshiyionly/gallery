# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a high-definition cover image management system for the multi-platform gallery application. The system will manage cover images with both original and high-definition versions, storing metadata in a MongoDB collection called "hd_cover" within the "emby" database. This feature enables the application to serve optimized cover images while maintaining references to original sources.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a gallery administrator, I want to store and manage HD cover images with their original URLs, so that I can provide high-quality cover images while maintaining source references.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a cover image is added THEN the system SHALL store the code, origin_url, and hd_url in the hd_cover collection
2. WHEN storing cover image data THEN the system SHALL validate that code is a non-empty string
3. WHEN storing cover image data THEN the system SHALL validate that origin_url is a valid URL string
4. WHEN storing cover image data THEN the system SHALL validate that hd_url is a valid URL string
5. IF any required field is missing or invalid THEN the system SHALL reject the operation with a validation error

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to retrieve HD cover images by code, so that I can display the appropriate cover image for media items.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN querying for a cover image by code THEN the system SHALL return the matching hd_cover document
2. WHEN no cover image exists for a given code THEN the system SHALL return null or appropriate not-found response
3. WHEN multiple cover images exist for the same code THEN the system SHALL return the most recently created one
4. WHEN retrieving cover images THEN the system SHALL include all fields (code, origin_url, hd_url)

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a gallery user, I want the application to automatically serve HD cover images when available, so that I get the best visual experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying a media item THEN the system SHALL attempt to load the HD cover image first
2. IF the HD cover image fails to load THEN the system SHALL fallback to the original URL
3. WHEN no cover image data exists THEN the system SHALL display a default placeholder image
4. WHEN loading cover images THEN the system SHALL implement proper error handling for network failures

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a gallery administrator, I want to update existing cover image URLs, so that I can maintain current and working image links.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN updating a cover image by code THEN the system SHALL modify the existing document
2. WHEN updating cover image URLs THEN the system SHALL validate the new URLs before saving
3. IF the code doesn't exist during update THEN the system SHALL create a new document
4. WHEN updating cover images THEN the system SHALL maintain data integrity and validation rules

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to bulk import cover image data, so that I can efficiently populate the system with existing image metadata.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing bulk import THEN the system SHALL process multiple cover image records
2. WHEN importing duplicate codes THEN the system SHALL update existing records rather than create duplicates
3. IF any record in a bulk import fails validation THEN the system SHALL continue processing other records and report failures
4. WHEN bulk import completes THEN the system SHALL provide a summary of successful and failed operations
